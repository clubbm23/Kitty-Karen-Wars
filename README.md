# Kitty-Karen-Wars
Competitive game where the BakerCat player tries to keep his business afloat while the KarenCat player tries to run him out of business.

How to Start:

Start the game by hitting the enter key on the keyboard. From here on out, you will need two controllers to play.

How to Play:

Both characters - Use the arrow hat buttons to move up, down, left, and right. Any ability other than the Annoy, Serve, and Cut Off Wifi abilities described below can only
                  be activated when the ability icon is colorful.

KarenCat - Use the Red Button (A) to Annoy Customer. This must be done while in very close range to/touching the customer. This will give you points every time.
           
           Use the Yellow Button (B) to activate your Salt Cakes ability. This must be done while in very close range to/touching any of the bakery's cakes. This
           immediately takes away some of BakerCat's points and makes it so that for the duration of the salting, if BakerCat serves a customer, you get points instead!

           Use the Blue Button (X) to Write Bad Yelp Review. This can be done no matter where you are. The Yelp ability takes away BakerCat's points over time.


BakerCat - Use the Green Button (Y) to Serve Customer. This must be done while in very close range to/touching the customer. This will give you points every time.
           
           Use the Yellow Button (B) to Give Out Free Samples. This can be done no matter where you are. Every time KarenCat touches a sample, they lose points!

           Use the Blue Button (X) to Activate Pusheen Wall. This can be done no matter where you are. This wall prevents KarenCat from entering or exiting the kitchen.

           Use the Red Button (A) to Cut Off Wifi. This must be done while in very close range to/touching the angry Yelping laptop. This stops your points from decreasing.
